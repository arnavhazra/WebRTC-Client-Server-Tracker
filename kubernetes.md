## Kubernetes Deployment

To deploy these Docker images on Kubernetes, we need to create Kubernetes manifest yaml files for the client and server deployments.

### Server Deployment (server-deployment.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: server-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: server_image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 12345
```

### Client Deployment (client-deployment.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: client-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: client
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: client
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: client
        image: client_image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 12345
```

To deploy these on a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the following commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f server-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f client-deployment.yaml
```

Please note that you need to have a Kubernetes cluster running. You can use Minikube, k3s, or microk8s for a local Kubernetes setup. For Minikube, you can start it with the command `minikube start`. For k3s, you can install it following the instructions on the [official k3s website](https://k3s.io/). For microk8s, you can install it following the instructions on the [official microk8s website](https://microk8s.io/).
